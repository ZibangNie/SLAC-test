National  foreword 

This  British  Standard  is  the  UK  implementation  of EN  13848-1:2019.It 
supersedes  BS  EN   13848-1:2003+A1:2008,which  is  withdrawn. 

The  UK  participation  in  its  preparation  was  entrusted  to  Technical 
Committee   RAE/2,Railway   Applications   -Track. 

A  list  of  organizations  represented  on  this  committee  can  be  obtained  on 
request  to  its  secretary. 

The  UK  committee   draws  users'attention  to  the   distinction  between 
normative  and  informative  elements,as  defined  in  Clause  3  of  the 
CEN/CENELEC  Internal  Regulations,Part  3. 

Normative:Requirements  conveying  criteria  to  be  fulfilled  if  compliance 
with  the  document  is  to  be  claimed  and  from  which  no  deviation 
is   permitted. 

Informative:Information  intended  to   assist  the  understanding   or  use   of 
the   document.Informative   annexes   do   not   contain   requirements,except 
as    optional  requirements,and    are  not  mandatory.For   example,a  test 
method  may  contain  requirements,but  there  is  no  need  to  comply  with 
these  requirements  to  claim  compliance  with  the   standard. 

When  speeds  in  km/h  require  unit  conversion  for  use  in  the  UK, 
users  are  advised  to  use  equivalent  values  rounded  to  the  nearest 
whole  number.The  use  of  absolute  values  for  converted  units  should 
be  avoided  in  these  cases.Please  refer  to  the  table  below  for  agreed   
conversion    figures:

6.1.1     General 

Track   gauge,G,is   the   smallest   distance   between   lines   perpendicular   to   the   running   surface   intersecting

6.1.7    Analysis    method 

Individual   defects   are   represented    by    the    amplitude   from   the    nominal    value    to   the    peak    value 
(minimum    and    maximum  peak  value). 

6.2      Longitudinal      level 
------------------------------------------------------------
6.2.1            General 

Longitudinal  level  is  the  deviation  znin  z-direction  of  running  table  levels  on  any  rail  from  the  smoothed 
vertical   position    (reference    line)expressed    in    defined    wavelength    ranges.The    smoothing    is    applied 
over  a  length  that  covers  the  wavelength  range  of  interest  (minimum  two  times  the  upper  limit  of  the 
wavelength    range    of   interest).The    reference    line    and    the    longitudinal    level    are    calculated    from 
successive    measurements   (refer   to   Figure   6).

6.2.2  Measurement  method 

Figure  6—Longitudinal  level 

Longitudinal  level  measurements  shall  be  made  with  either  an  inertial  system  or  a  versine  system(that 
should  preferably  be  asymmetric)or  by  a  combination  of  both  methods.If  the  versine  method  of 
measurement  is  used,a  decolouring  of  the  measured  signals  is  necessary  in  order  to  eliminate  the 
influence of the transfer function of the versine  system(see Annex A). 

NOTE        In the case of limited analysis length,the longitudinal level can be evaluated also from geodetic 
measurements. 
------------------------------------------------------------
6.2.3  Wavelength  range 

Three  ranges  expressed  in  wavelengths  ()shall  be  considered: 

—D1:3m<λ≤25        m; 

一  D2:25m<λ≤70      m; 

一  D3:70m<λ≤150  m,used  for  measuring  long  wavelength  defects.Generally  this  range  should  only 

be  considered  for  line  speeds  greater  than  230  km/h. 

NOTE        Other wavelengths longer than 70m can also be taken into consideration by the vertical curvature 
parameter(refer to Annex B);however,this does not give an equivalent assessment of D3 domain. 

In  order  to  detect  short  wavelength  defects,which  can  generate  high  dynamic  forces,an  optional 
wavelength  range  can  be  considered: 

D0:1m<λ≤5m                                                                                                                                       (1)

6.3    Cross    level 
------------------------------------------------------------
6.3.1  General 

The  difference  in  height  of the  adjacent  running  tables  computed  from  the  angle  between  the  running 
surface  and  a  horizontal  reference  plane.It  is  expressed  as  the  height  of  the  vertical  leg  of  the  right- 
angled  triangle  having  a  hypotenuse  that  relates  to  the  nominal  track  gauge  plus  the  width  of the  rail 
head  rounded  to  the  nearest  10  mm(refer  to  Figure  7). 
Cross  level is also called cant or superelevation. 

NOTE         For nominal gauge of 1435 mm the hypotenuse is 1500 mm in length. 

For nominal gauges of 1520 mm and  1524 mm the hypotenuse is 1600 mm in length. 

For nominal gauge of 1668 mm the hypotenuse is 1740 mm in length.

Alignment is the  deviation ypin y-direction  of the position  of point P(refer to  6.1.1)on any rail from the 
smoothed  lateral  position  (reference  line)expressed  in  defined  wavelength  ranges.The  smoothing  is 
applied  over  a  length  that  covers  the  wavelength  range  of interest(minimum  two  times  the  upper  limit 
of  the   wavelength  range    of  interest).The   reference  line  and  the   alignment  are  calculated  from

If  the  versine  method  of measurement  is  used,a  decolouring  of the  measured  signals  is  necessary  in

In  order  to  detect  short  wavelength  defects,which  can  generate  high  dynamic  forces,an  optional

—D0:1m<λ≤5m. 

When  measuring  in the  domain  D0,the  sampling  distance  should be reduced to  0,1m.Due to the  lack  of

Decolouring   process 

A.1    Definition     of    decolouring 

If  track  geometry  is  recorded  with  a  chord  measurement  system,the  measured  signals  (versine)of 
longitudinal  level  and  alignment  are  distorted  in  magnitude  and  phase.The  process  of  compensating 
these  distortions  of  the  signals  is   called  "decolouring”,i.e.removing  the  “colour"due  to  the   chord 
measurement. 

For  example,decolouring  of  a  chord  measurement  is  required  if  the  track   geometry  is  assessed 
according to the EN  13848  series or if used for simulation purposes. 

The  distortion  depends  on  the  chord  length  and  on  the  chord  division.In  the  case  of  an  asymmetric 
chord  division,it  also  depends  on  the  running  direction  of the  measurement  car.As  an  example  for  the 
distortion,Figure   A.1   shows   a   comparison   between   chord   measurement   and   the   corresponding 
decoloured  signal  along  a  short track  section.

Figure  A.1—Example  of  distortion  due  to  chord  measurement 

The  distortion  can  be  described  with  the  help  of the  transfer  function.The  magnitude  of the  transfer 
function  represents  the  amplification  factor  as  a  function  of  the  wavelength.The  magnitude  lies

between  0  and  2.As  an  example,Figure  A.2  shows  the  transfer  function  of  a   10m  chord  measurement 
system  with  a  chord  division  of  4m  and  6m.A  magnitude  of  zero,seen  at  2m  wavelength,means  that 
this  wavelength  is  not  recorded  at  all  and  cannot  be  restored.Long  waves  are  also  strongly  diminished; 
the    maximum    wavelength    which   can   be    reasonably    restored   in   this   case   is   about   30m   to   50m. 
Generally,small  values  of  the  magnitude   of  the  transfer   function  mean  a  disadvantageous  signal-to- 
noise  ratio,where  decolouring  is  likely  to  malfunction.

A.3    Verification    of    a     decolouring    process 

A.3.1     Introduction 

The verification of a decolouring process can be done in two ways: 

一  using  test  signals; 

—through  verifications  on  recorded  track  geometry  data. 

The  signals used in these procedures  should cover the  full wavelength range  of interest. 

A.3.2    Verification    with    test   signals 

The off-line verification as shown in Figure A.3 is possible if a test signal containing undistorted (i.e.not 
affected   by   transfer    functions   of   chord   measuring    systems)track   geometry   with    all   relevant 
wavelengths  is  available. 

The  test  signal  can  be  either  a  simulated  signal  or  a  real  measure  coming  from  a  measuring  system 
(inertial  or  geodetic). 

For example,verification of decolouring in D1 and D2 can be done through the following steps: 

1)Filtering of the test signal in D1 and D2 with a filter according to the definition in Annex C; 

2)Calculating  the  versine  of the  test  signal  considering  the  given  chord  length  and  division; 

3)Applying  the  decolouring  and  filtering  in  D1  and  D2  to  the  versine; 

4)Comparing  the  signals  obtained  at  point  1  and  point  3.

The  comparison  of signals  at point  4  can be  done  in the  space  domain  and  in the  frequency  domain by 
computing  the transfer  function  and  coherence  function  between  the  output  signals  of points  1and  3. 
For other wavelength ranges  a  similar process can be applied.

A.3.3    Verification    with   recorded   track   geometry   data 

Verification  from  recorded  data  are  useful  if the  decolouring  algorithm  is  not  known,or  a  test  signal  is 
not  available.In this  case the  cross  check between  track  gauge  and  difference  of decoloured  and  filtered 
alignment  or  between   cross  level  and  difference  of  decoloured  and  filtered  longitudinal  level  is 
suggested. 

In  order to  verify  the  compensation  of the  amplitude  and phase  of the transfer  function the  cross  check 
shall  be  applied in the  space domain. 

Cross  check between the  track  gauge  and the  difference between  the  alignment  of the  left  and  the right 
rail  should  be  preferred.This  is  due  to  the  higher  accuracy  of  the  track  gauge  measurement  with 
respect to the  cross  level. 

The verification is done according to the following steps: 

1)Filtering  of track  gauge  with  a  filter  according  to  Annex  C; 

2)Comparison  between  the  filtered  track  gauge  and  the  difference  between  the  alignment  of  the  left 

and the right rail in the same wavelength range.Figure A.4 below gives an example for D1.

Other parameters 

B.1      Introduction 

The principal track geometric parameters are described in the relevant part of this standard.However, 
other  parameters  contribute  to  an  understanding  of vehicle  track  interaction  and  ride  quality.These 
other  parameters  can  be  obtained  by  direct  measurement  or  by  derived  measurement.Other 
supportive  data  may  be  necessary  in  order  to  facilitate  calculation  of the  derived  measurements.A 
representative list of other parameters is shown in the following. 

B.2    Parameters    obtained    by    direct     measurement 

The following parameters can be measured directly: 
一  Horizontal  curvature(1/m); 

一  Vertical  curvature(1/m); 

—Gradient(mm/m); 

—Acceleration  (m/s²)(refer  to  Annex  E). 

B.3   Parameters   obtained   by    derived   measurement   to    establish   in-service   values 

B.3.1   Cyclic  irregularities 

Cyclic irregularities are a derailment risk that involves a harmonic response by specific types of railway 
vehicles.Such vehicles are built with a suspension system that is vulnerable to this phenomenon. 

A  cyclic isolated defect occurs when a measured parameter (e.g.longitudinal level at D1)has a value 
that  repeats  at  a  set  frequency  along  the  track  which  induces  the  harmonic  response  to  the  vehicle 
suspension.Energy builds up in the  suspension if cycles of input continue,until the vehicle wheel sets 
unload;leading to derailment. 

The peak values  of input that trigger the harmonic response  can  all be below  Intervention Limit IL 
(EN  13848-5:2017).It  is  the  combined  fixed  wavelength  and  repetitive  nature  of these  values  that 
trigger the harmonic reaction. 

Detection is usually made by  an  algorithm linked to the measured parameter  and  can  span  different 
wavelengths to match known susceptible vehicle types. 

There are several different types of cyclic irregularity some of which are listed below: 
一  Cyclic Longitudinal Level (or Cyclic Top); 

一  Cyclic Cross Fall (or Cyclic Twist). 

Mitigation of the derailment risk with this type of phenomenon is usually undertaken by a combination 
of speed restriction to eliminate the harmonic response as well as manual/mechanical intervention.

All   Alert    (AL),Intervention         (IL)    and     Immediate     action    limits    (IAL)    are     derived     by 
experimentation/experience. 

Cyclic  irregularities  are  more  susceptible  when  combined  with  other  isolated  defects  such  as  Twist  or 
Alignment. 

B.3.2    Dip   angle 

A  'Dip Angle'as  defined in Figure B.1  gives pre-indication  of a potential rail  end break.Detection  of dip 
angles  therefore  enables  early  intervention  to  such  a  derailment  risk,especially  in jointed  track. 

Dip  angles  are  measured  over  a  very  short  wavelength(D0)and  derived  from  an  algorithm  that 
calculates  the  derivative  of  longitudinal  level  to  determine  the  localized'gradient'and  hence  the  'Dip 
Angle’θ  measured  in  milliradians.The  higher  the  dip  angle  the  more  impact  force  the  rail  end  will 
experience  with passing traffic. 

AL,IL  and  IAL  values  are  then  set,with  corresponding  intervention  time  scales  and  potential  speed 
restrictions. 

Rail  ends  are  not  rigid  and  hence  the  value  of the  measured  dip  angle  can  change  dependent  upon  the 
speed,load  and  direction  of travel  of the  measuring  vehicle.

Filter          requirements 

C.1     General     requirements 

In  order to  ensure  a  correct  application  of the track quality levels given  in  EN  13848-5:2017,and in 
order to compare data of different measuring systems(of different manufacturers),a standardization of 
the filters for the different wavelength domains of longitudinal level and alignment is necessary. 

The filters are required to have linear phase and a damping of-3dB at the cut-off frequency.Tolerance 
bands for the transfer functions(magnitude responses)in the wavelength ranges D1 and D2 are given 
in C.2 below.Due to the lack of experience no tolerance bands and requirements for the slope are given 
for  D3  and  D0.It  is  recommended  that  the  transfer  functions  remain  within  these  tolerance  bands. 
However,e.g.in  order  to  maintain  data  history  it  might  be  necessary  to  choose  a  transfer  function 
which is partly outside of the tolerance band.If the transfer function is below the lower limit given in 
the tables below,the limit values of part  5  shall be adapted accordingly (see  also D.5).If the transfer 
function is  above the upper  limit,the  output values willbe increased.Since  this is  on  the  safe  side,no 
further action is required for the safety assessment. 

Diagrams ofthe filter transfer functions (including the tolerance band limits in case of D1 and D2)shall 
be provided together with the measurement output data. 

C.2   Tolerance   bands   for   filter   transfer   functions 

C.2.1    Introduction 

The tables in the following clauses give the tolerance bands for the transfer functions in D1 and D2, 
respectively. 

C.2.2  Filter  for  D1 

D1 has the following cut-off frequencies: 

一    flow=0,04 m-1          (wavelength  25m) 
一  fhigh=0,3333m-1      (wavelength  3m)

Figure  D.6—Scatter  plot  of peak  values  in  sections 

The  same  kind  of analysis  with  various  realistic  filters  inside  the  tolerance  band  has  shown  very  small 
differences  with  average  errors  not  more  than  1%. 

In  a  second  example,for  the  wavelength  range  D2,an  FIR  filter  of  order  400  with-6dB  instead  of-3dB 
at the  cut-off wavelengths  is  demonstrated.The transfer  function  of this  filter is  displayed in Figure D.7, 
together  with  the  transfer  function  of  the  reference  filter(Butterworth,zero-phase)and  of  the  lower 
limit  of  the  tolerance  band.This  FIR  filter  is  clearly  below  the  tolerance  limit  in  the  whole  D2 
wavelength  range.Accordingly,the  scatter  plot  in  Figure  D.8  shows  maximum  amplitudes  significantly 
lower  than  with  the  reference  filter.The  average  error  is  14%.

Another  example  for  wavelength  range  D2  demonstrates  an  FIR  filter  of  order  700  using  Hamming

Measurement  of  acceleration 

E.1      Introduction 

Acceleration measurements can be used to give an indication of track geometry quality and to detect 
the  local track geometry  deviations which have an influence on the dynamic behaviour of a vehicle. 
These measurements should be used in conjunction with the main parameter measurements described 
in  the  standard.However,acceleration  measurements  are  sensitive  to  the  dynamic  behaviour  of  the 
vehicle  and  other  factors  such  as  climatic  conditions,actual  position  of the  vehicle  in  the  train  and 
wheel rail interaction. 

E.2     Measurement     method 

Measurements  can  be  taken  at  various  locations  on  the  car  body  and/or  bogie  depending  upon  the 
particular  assessment required. 

—C1-vertical  axle  box  acceleration  -for  the  detection  of rail  surface  defects  (e.g.corrugation)and 

isolated geometrical defects. 

—C2-transverse  bogie  acceleration  for  the  detection  of  short  wavelength  track  geometry  defects 

(alignment or cross level). 

—C3-transverse and vertical car body acceleration for the detection of defects that have an influence 

on comfort.

E.5    Sampling    frequency 

The  sampling  frequency  should  be  at  least  5  times  the  cut-off  frequency  applied  to  the  signal 
e.g.≥2500 Hz for axle box acceleration (i.e.5×500 Hz).

range.This can be used for assessing corrugation and/or density of short geometric defects of 
the rail; 

·     Double integration of the signal in a given frequency range in order to obtain a representation 
of short defects of track geometry.This method can be also used for calculating longitudinal 
level.

from  the  mean  value  to  the  peak  value  or  from  zero  to  the  peak  value  as  defined  by  the 
Infrastructure Manager.

Track geometry data for simulation purposes 

F.1      Introduction 

The  dynamic  behaviour  of a  railway  vehicle  and  its  interaction  with  track  can  be  simulated  with  a 
computer  software  system  including  models  for  vehicle,track  and  wheel-rail  contact.The  use  of 
measured track geometry data allows simulating the vehicle dynamics under real conditions.Important 
applications  for  the  vehicles  are  the  virtual  homologation,investigation  of  possible  designs  or 
parameter changes.Additionally,simulations can be used  for the assessment of track geometry based 
on vehicle responses. 

This  annex  gives  information  about  which  data  are  required  in  order  to  successfully  perform 
simulations.The  required  data  are  similar to the  data used  for track  geometry  assessment  and hence 
can be provided by most track measurement systems.The main difference is the extended wavelength 
range of longitudinal level and alignment.Moreover,track layout data like curvature can be included. 

F.2 Contents of track geometry data for simulation purposes 

Measured track geometry  data typically includes track irregularity  data  as well  as track layout  data. 
Both are needed in order to perform realistic simulations. 

Track irregularity data of longitudinal level and alignment are used as excitation signals for the dynamic 
analysis of a vehicle-track system.This requires undistorted track geometry and therefore decolouring 
in  case  of chord measurement  data.The  required wavelength  content  depends  on the purpose  of the 
simulation and on the considered speed (see F.3 for details).It differs from the D1 and D2 domains. 

Track gauge and cross level shallbe provided in addition to longitudinal level and alignment.It is not 
sufficient to compute track gauge as the difference of alignment and cross level as the difference of 
longitudinal  level,since  these  have   a  limited  wavelength   range  and  therefore  do  not   contain 
information about e.g.track gauge widening in curves. 

Measured  track  layout  data  can  include  (horizontal)curvature,cant  and  vertical  curvature.It  can 
deviate from the nominal track layout,which is typically given in tabular form as a sequence of track 
layout  elements  like  straight  lines,transition  curves,etc.In  contrast,measured  track  layout  data  are 
sampled  at  the  same  interval  as  the  track  irregularity  data,e.g.at  25cm.For  simulations,measured 
track  layout  data  are  preferred  over  nominal  layout  data,because  it  reflects  the  real  situation  on  the 
track,and  because  a  potential  shift  along  the  track  between  two  different  data  sources  is  avoided. 
Measured (horizontal)curvature is provided by most recording systems. 

All data should be synchronized along the track. 

In summary,the following signals are required for simulations: 
—longitudinal level of left and right rail(extended wavelength range); 

—alignment of left  and right rail(extended wavelength range); 

—track   gauge; 

—cross   level;

—(horizontal)curvature. 

In addition,information about the line speed and the signal of vertical curvature can be required. 

The used sign convention shall be stated for all signals. 

F.3    Extended    wavelength    range 

For homologation purposes,vehicle  dynamics  is  assessed  for  frequencies  from  0,4 Hz  to  20 Hz.The 
excitation due to track irregularities shallcover this frequency range,because otherwise the simulation 
results will be incomplete.Depending on the vehicle speed,this frequency range corresponds to various 
wavelength ranges,see Table F.1.If it is not possible to provide the full wavelength range,Table F.2 can 
be used to identify the corresponding frequency range for a particular wavelength range.It then has to 
be  discussed individually  about how  a limited  frequency range will  affect the validity  of simulation 
results.

In general,a wavelength range from  1m to 200 m is provided by modern track recording systems.This 
covers the required frequency range for most speed categories. 

F.4     Numerical     resolution 

If track data  are given with low numerical resolution,the  signals can become  step-like,with repeated 
samples  of  identical  amplitude  and  jumps  which  are  much  larger  than  in  reality.This  will  lead  to 
unrealistic  simulation  results.It  is therefore recommended to provide track  data  in  a high numerical

BS         EN          13848-1:2019 
EN         13848-1:2019(E) 

resolution,e.g.with   10-3mm.This   is   clearly    beyond   the    precision   of   the   measurement    system,butt 
prevents  problems  in  the  simulation. 

F.5       Pre-processing        for        simulation 

After  the  track  geometry  data  has  been  provided,some  pre-processing  is  necessary  in  order  to  make  the 
measurement       data        suited        for        simulations. 

Track  measurement  data  typically  contains  both  irregularity  and  layout  data.It  shall  be  ensured  that 
there  is  no  overlap  and  no  gap  of  the  wavelength  content  between  the  respective  signals,in  particular 
between  alignment  and  curvature.Filtering  may  be  used,where  the  cut-off  wavelength  depends  on  the 
line  characteristics  like  curve  radiiand  transition  lengths. 

For  simulation,depending  on  the  software,it  can  be  necessary  or  may  be  preferred  to  convert  the  track 
irregularities  of  the   individual  rails  (as  given  by  most  measurement   systems)to  irregularities  at  the 
track    centre.Figure    F.1    depicts    both   representations.The   nominal   track    centre   Co   and  the  nominal 
tangent  to  to  the  top  of  both  rails  define  the  nominal  position  of  the  track  and  its  rails.The  actual  track 
centre  C  lies  on  the  actual  tangenttto  the  top  of  both  rails  in  the  middle  between  the  track  gauge  points 
Pl  and  Pr.With  respect  to  Co,the  position  of  C  is  defined  by  the  lateral  displacement  y  and  the  vertical 
displacementz,andtis  rotated  by  α  with  respect  to  to.Together  with  the  actual  track  gauge  g,the  actual 
position  of  both  rails  is  defined.If  the  irregularities  are  referring  to  the  individual  rails,the  left  and  right 
vertical  deviations  zl  and  zr  are  the  vertical  distances  from  the  top  of  rail  points  Tl  and  Tr  to  to.The  left 
and  right  lateral  deviations  yl  and  yr  plus  half  of  the  nominal  track  gauge  go  give  the  lateral  distances 
from  Pl  and  Pr  to  Co.The  arrows  in  the  figure  indicate  positive  signs  of the  displacements  and  rotation.

Figure   F.1—Track    centre   related    and    rail   related    irregularities 

A   conversion    from   rail   related    signals   to    track   centre    related   signals    (and   vice   versa)can    be 
accomplished  by  the   following  formulas.The  lateral  base  b   is  the   distance  between   Tl  and  Tr,where 
typically   only    the   nominal   value    is   used.The   angle   α   is   assumed  to  be   small.Differences   in   the 
wavelength  ranges  of the  signals  are  not  considered  in  the  formulas. 

y=(yl+yr)/2          yl=y-(g-g0)/2 

z=(zl+zr)/2          yr=y+(g-g0)/2 

α=(zr-zl)/b           zl=z-α*b/2 

g=yr-yl+g0          zr=z+α*b/2
